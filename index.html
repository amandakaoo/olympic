                <p>The <b>first modern Olympics </b> were held in Athens, Greece. In the opening ceremony, King Georgios I and a crowd of 60,000
                  spectators welcomed 241 participants from 14 nations (all male), who would compete in 43 events, including track and field, gymnastics,
                  swimming, wrestling, cycling, tennis, weightlifting, shooting and fencing. A crowd estimated at more than 60,000 attended the opening day
                   of competition. Members of the royal family of Greece played an important role in the organization and management of the Games. </p>

                <p> <b> Women </b> were allowed to take part for the first time. The Games of 1900 were held in Paris as part of the World’s Fair.
                  The Games suffered from poor organization and marketing. The organisers <em>spread the competitions over five months</em> and under-promoted
                  their Olympic status to such an extent that many athletes never knew they had actually participated in the Olympic Games. Nevertheless,
                  French athletes earned more than 100 medals, by far the most for any nation at the 1900 Games.</p>

                <p>The events were held in Missouri, United States. Unfortunately, the St Louis Games repeated all of the mistakes of 1900.
                The various competitions were spread out over <em>four-and-a-half months</em> and became lost in the chaos of a World’s Fair celebrating
                 the purchase of the Louisiana territory from France. As a result, the Games suffered. The 1904 Olympic Games were <b>the first at which gold,
                 silver and bronze medals were awarded for first, second and third place.</b> However,the overall results were predictably lopsided,
                 with Americans earning more than three-fourths of the 95 gold medals and more than 230 medals in all. </p>

                <p>The Stockholm Games were a model of efficiency. The Swedish hosts introduced the first Olympic use of automatic timing devices for the track events,
                  the photo finish and a public address system. <b>For the first time, competitors in the Games came from all five continents.</b> It was also the first time

                  of the Olympic Games was raised for the first time at an Olympic Games. The Olympic oath was taken for the first time by an athlete on behalf of all competitors, and

                <p>The 1924 Games represented a coming of age for the Olympics. International federations had gained more influence over their respective sports, standardizing the rules of competition,
                  and national Olympic organizations in most countries conducted trials to ensure that the best athletes were sent to compete. After the 1924 Games, tennis was dropped from Olympic
                  competition because of questions over the amateur standing of many participants. The sport did not return to the Olympics until 1988. </p>
                <p>At the Closing Ceremony, the practice of <b>raising
                  three flags (one for the International Olympic Committee, one for the host country and one for the future host country of the Games)</b> was instigated.</p>

                    <p>This is a web map that introduce the stadiums and the cities that have hosted the Summer Olympic Games
                      in history from 1896. This July and August, one of the leading international sporting events should be host
                      in Tokyo. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus, the event was postponed until next year. This project also analyzes the
                      impact of the postponement of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, from athletes to economics. Right now, the loss is already inevitable.
                      Tokyo and the whole World are expecting the Olympic can be successfully held before next summer. Not every athlete
                      has the next 4 years to wait.</p>

                    <p> It is mainly made as a project for a course GEOG 458:
                        Advanced Digital Geographies at the University of Washington, Seattle.
                        The story map library is derived from the
                        storymap plugin for leaflet at <a>http://atlefren.github.io/storymap/</a>, and its functionality
                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
